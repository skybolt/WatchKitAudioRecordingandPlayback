Refer to this sample if you want to learn how to present an AudioRecordingViewController to record and save audio and/or see how to present a MediaPlaybackController for playback of an asset. This project also use new features in WatchKit 2.0 including WatchConnectivity's file transfer capabilities to move the audio file recorded on your Apple Watch back to the paired iOS device, as well as WKInterfacePicker to display the different audio recording settings. In order to get WatchConnectivity working with your sample modify the SAMPLE_BUNDLE_PREFIX in the project to match your bundle identifier.
